# JPA Relationships - Interview & Exam Quick Reference

## ⚡ Super Quick Answers

### Q: What are the 3 types of JPA relationships?
**A:** 
1. **One-to-Many (1:N)** - One parent has many children
2. **Many-to-One (N:1)** - Many children belong to one parent  
3. **One-to-One (1:1)** - Each entity uniquely associated

### Q: Are One-to-Many and Many-to-One the same?
**A:** YES! Same relationship, different perspective.
- One-to-Many: Parent perspective ("I have many children")
- Many-to-One: Child perspective ("I belong to one parent")

### Q: Where does the Foreign Key go?
**A:** Always on the **MANY side** (Child table)
```
User → Property: FK goes in PROPERTY table (properties.owner_id)
Property → Image: FK goes in IMAGE table (property_images.property_id)
```

### Q: What makes One-to-One different?
**A:** The **UNIQUE constraint** on the foreign key!
```java
@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "user_id", unique = true)  // ← UNIQUE is key!
private User user;
```

### Q: What does `mappedBy` mean?
**A:** It tells which field on the OPPOSITE side owns the relationship.
```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "owner")  // owner field in Property owns this relationship
```

### Q: What's the difference between FetchType.LAZY and EAGER?
**A:** 
- **LAZY**: Load child data only when accessed (Better performance)
- **EAGER**: Load child data immediately with parent (Use sparingly)

## 🎯 Code Templates

### Template 1: One-to-Many

```java
// PARENT SIDE
@Entity
public class User {
    @OneToMany(
        mappedBy = "owner",              // Field name in child
        cascade = CascadeType.ALL,       // Propagate changes
        fetch = FetchType.LAZY           // Load on demand
    )
    private List<Property> properties = new ArrayList<>();
}

// CHILD SIDE
@Entity
public class Property {
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(
        name = "owner_id",               // Column name in DB
        nullable = true                  // Can be empty
    )
    private User owner;
}
```

### Template 2: One-to-One

```java
// OWNING SIDE (has the FK)
@Entity
public class Subscription {
    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(
        name = "user_id",
        nullable = false,
        unique = true                    // CRITICAL FOR 1:1
    )
    private User user;
}

// INVERSE SIDE (mapped from other side)
@Entity
public class User {
    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "user", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    private Subscription subscription;
}
```

### Template 3: Many-to-Many (via Junction)

```java
// PARENT SIDE 1
@Entity
public class User {
    @OneToMany(
        mappedBy = "user",
        cascade = CascadeType.ALL,
        fetch = FetchType.LAZY
    )
    private List<Favorite> favorites = new ArrayList<>();
}

// JUNCTION TABLE
@Entity
@Table(
    uniqueConstraints = @UniqueConstraint(
        columnNames = {"user_id", "property_id"}
    )
)
public class Favorite {
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "user_id")
    private User user;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @JoinColumn(name = "property_id")
    private Property property;
}
```

## 💡 Common Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: What is the difference between @OneToMany and @ManyToOne?
```
@OneToMany:
- Used on parent/owner side
- Represents collection of children
- @OneToMany(mappedBy = "owner")
- Collection type: List<Child>

@ManyToOne:
- Used on child side
- Represents single parent
- @ManyToOne @JoinColumn(name = "owner_id")
- Single object type: Parent
```

### Q2: Why do we use `mappedBy`?
```
It tells Spring who owns the relationship.

Example:
User has @OneToMany(mappedBy = "owner")
Property has @ManyToOne @JoinColumn(name = "owner_id")

The "owner" field in Property is the ACTUAL owner of relationship.
The @OneToMany just uses mappedBy to reference it.

Why? To avoid creating two foreign keys pointing each other.
```

### Q3: What happens with CascadeType.ALL?
```
When parent is affected, child follows:

DELETE parent → DELETE all children
SAVE parent → SAVE all children  
UPDATE parent → UPDATE all children
MERGE parent → MERGE all children
REFRESH parent → REFRESH all children
DETACH parent → DETACH all children

Careful! Can cause unexpected deletions!
```

### Q4: What is orphanRemoval?
```
When you remove a child from parent's collection,
child is deleted from database.

Example:
property.removeImage(image);  // Remove from list
imageRepository.save(...);    // Image is deleted!

Usually paired with cascade = CascadeType.ALL
```

### Q5: How to enforce One-to-One relationship?
```
Use UNIQUE constraint on Foreign Key:

@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "user_id", unique = true)
         ↑
    This is CRITICAL!

What it does:
- subscriptions.user_id must be UNIQUE
- Prevents user_id = 1 appearing twice
- Enforces 1:1 at database level
```

### Q6: Lazy vs Eager Loading?
```
LAZY (Default, Better):
- Load child only when accessed
- user.getProperties()  ← Triggers query here
- Better performance
- Prevents N+1 problem

EAGER (Avoid):
- Load child immediately with parent
- SELECT users, properties at same time
- More data loaded upfront
- Can be inefficient
```

### Q7: What's a junction table?
```
For Many-to-Many relationships:

User (many) ↔ Property (many)

Create junction table:
FAVORITE table:
┌─────────┬──────────────┐
│ user_id │ property_id  │
├─────────┼──────────────┤
│ 1       │ 101          │
│ 1       │ 102          │
│ 2       │ 101          │
│ 2       │ 103          │
└─────────┴──────────────┘

Result:
- User 1 favorited properties 101, 102
- User 2 favorited properties 101, 103
- Property 101 favorited by users 1, 2
```

### Q8: How to fetch relationships?
```
Lazy Loading:
User user = userRepository.findById(1L).get();
List<Property> props = user.getProperties();  // Query here

Eager Loading (configured in entity):
@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)

EntityGraph (dynamic):
@EntityGraph(attributePaths = {"properties"})
User findWithProperties(Long id);
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: LazyInitializationException
```
Error: "failed to lazily initialize a collection"

Cause: Accessing lazy relationship after session closed

Solutions:
- Use @Transactional on method
- Set fetch = FetchType.EAGER (not recommended)
- Use EntityGraph to specify loading
- Manually load in query: left join fetch
```

### Issue 2: Stack Overflow (Infinite Recursion)
```
Error: "Infinite recursion in JSON serialization"

Cause: User has properties, Property has owner (User)
       JSON tries to serialize both forever

Solutions:
- Add @JsonIgnoreProperties({"owner"}) on User
- Add @JsonIgnoreProperties({"properties"}) on Property
- Use DTOs instead of entities
```

### Issue 3: Constraint Violation
```
Error: "Unique constraint violation"

If One-to-One without unique = true:

@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "user_id")  // ← Missing unique = true!
private User user;

Fix:
@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "user_id", unique = true)
```

### Issue 4: Orphaned Records
```
Error: "Records still exist but not referenced"

Cause: Removed from collection but didn't delete

Solution:
@OneToMany(orphanRemoval = true)  // Add this!
```
